## âœ… Step 2: Stage, Commit & Push

Back in your terminal:
```bash
git add CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -m "Add CONTRIBUTING guide for new users"
git push origin main
Once pushed, your guide will be live in the repo and visible to all contributors. Want to add a README.md next or set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD? Iâ€™ve got you covered.

cd CodeApps touch CONTRIBUTING.md cd: no such file or directory: CodeApps
Ah, that means you're not currently in the folder where your project lives â€” or it might be named differently than CodeApps. Let's find it and create the CONTRIBUTING.md file properly.

âœ… Step-by-Step Fix
1. Locate Your Project Folder
Run:

bash
ls
Look for the folder that contains your React app â€” it might be named something like:

codeapps

CodeApps

AppFromScratch

If you see it, navigate into it:

bash
cd codeapps
(Use the exact name and capitalization.)

2. Create the CONTRIBUTING.md File
Once inside your project folder:

bash
touch CONTRIBUTING.md
Then open it in VS Code:

bash
code CONTRIBUTING.md
Paste the full contributor guide I gave you earlier into the file.

3. Stage, Commit, and Push
bash
git add CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -m "Add CONTRIBUTING guide for new users"
git push origin main
